This website was created using:
- HTML
- LESS
- GreenSock
- Google Fonts (Roboto, Yellowtail)
- Scroll Reveal

To implement this project yourself, you will need to run a less compiler.
If you do not have less, [this](http://lesscss.org/usage/) is where you can 
learn more about it.

Here is the code to run in the terminal:
`less-watch-compiler less css index.less`
